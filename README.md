# Command-Line-Calculator
Just a simple calculator app you can use just by typing.

I wrote this because I seldom used the Windows calculator and instead typed calculations right into the windows search bar because I found the calculator slow and cumbersome to open and use. Most of the time, this shows up as a bing search which has the result. The advantage of this is that all I need to do is quickly hit the windows key and start typing. The problem is that this uses bing ðŸ¤® and it doesn't work all of the time (sometimes it thinks you're trying to search for files). On my PC, I have this linked to run whenever I type a keyboard shortcut.
